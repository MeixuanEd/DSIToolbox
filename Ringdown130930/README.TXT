This disk contains Version 3.1.8 of the Ringdown
Analysis Tool component of the BPA/PNNL DSI toolbox.
This is a beta version that is current as of

    folder that is part of the MATLAB installation.

3.  Launch MATLAB.  Using the 'Set Path' item that is
    under the 'File' menu, append the newly installed
    'dsitools' folder to the MATLAB search path.
