To begin using the DSI toolbox, first the entire path must be added
to your current MATLAB path.  There are two ways to do this in MATLAB.

1A. Utilize the MATLAB GUI to add the DSI toolbox to the path.  1A and 1B below depend on
    which version of MATLAB you are running (newer versions are 1A, older have 1B).
    1AA.  Click the "Set Path" button under the "Home" tab on the top of the MATLAB window.
    1AB.  Go to File->"Set Path" menu option on the top of the MATLAB window.
	
	-- After finding the "Set Path" button/item, click the "Add with Subfolders" button
	-- Locate the base folder of the DSI Toolbox (the folder with this file in it) and
	   hit "Select Folder"
	-- After adding the path, you can either "Close" or "Save and Close", depending on if you
	   want this saved in the MATLAB path for just this session, or forever.

1B.	Utilize a MATLAB command to add the DSI Toolbox to the working path for the current session.
    This can be done with the MATLAB command:
		
		addpath(genpath('C:\MATLABToolBoxes\DSITools'));
	
	where "C:\MATLABToolBoxes\DSITools" is the path to the parent folder of the DSI Toolbox.

2.	After adding the DSI Toolbox to the appropriate path, it can now be launched with the command:

	PSMbrowser
	
	If you wish to utilize the SQL connection capability, please follow the "SQL_Database_Interface.txt"
	instructions before executing PSMbrowser.
