# DSIToolbox
Dynamic System Identification Toolbox
Developed at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory with contributions
from other government entities and universities.

The DSI Toolbox provides unique capabilities in the analysis and control of
large dynamic systems. It is designed to run with MATLAB, providing flexibility
in using, tailoring, and integrating the functionality in combination with
other tools. Its functions include data format conversion, data merging, data
filtering, data batch plotting, Fourier analysis, Prony analysis, and ModeMeter.

The DSI Toolbox is primarily oriented toward the analysis of phasor measurement
unit-based information.  Please visit the website for the North American
SynchroPhasor Initiative (NASPI - http://www.naspi.org) for more details on 
phasor measurement unit analysis and other tools.
